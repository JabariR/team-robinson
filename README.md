# Team Robinson site

Here we just have a simple text document of the content for the site. The conted is also in order that it will appear.

## Notes
1. No HTML Errors
1. Just a couple CSS Errors

I looks like the validator doesn't know what Calc() is yet. Calc is supported by all major browsers though, chech [CanIUse](http://caniuse.com/#search=calc). This is a [known bug in the validator](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=18913).

## Todo
[x] - Add content only text file. I need to write the content for my site in order in a text document.
[x] - Mark-up content with HTML. I need to show the browser where each piece of content starts and stops.
[x] - Add structure with HTML. I now have the content marked up with the correct HTML for each piece of content. I need to use HTML to structure the content so it follows the layout of my design.
[x] - Style the site with CSS. I now have the structure in, a the content is following the layout that I designed. I need to use CSS to style the text, colors etc.
[x] - More styling to do and link images up. Basic CSS is in. How I need to complete the styles.
[x] - Debug code. I now have the site styled. I need to use the HTML [WC3 Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and CSS [WC3 CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validators to check my code.
[] - Make internal pages. My code has been debugged and is passing the tests. I need to add my internal pages. I need to make sure that I get my links right.
