# Team Robinson site

Here we just have a simple text document of the content for the site. The conted is also in order that it will appear.

## Notes
1. We added Classes to make each section unique and modular.
2. We linked an external stylesheet to the site
3. We added basic CSS to set default styles for the site.

## Todo
[x] - Add content only text file. I need to write the content for my site in order in a text document.
[x] - Mark-up content with HTML. I need to show the browser where each piece of content starts and stops.
[x] - Add structure with HTML. I now have the content marked up with the correct HTML for each piece of content. I need to use HTML to structure the content so it follows the layout of my design.
[x] - Style the site with CSS. I now have the structure in, a the content is following the layout that I designed. I need to use CSS to style the text, colors etc.
[x] - More styling to do and link images up. Basic CSS is in. How I need to complete the styles.
[] - Debug code. I now have the site styled. I need to use the HTML [WC3 Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and CSS [WC3 CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validators to check my code.
[] - Make internal pages. My code has been debugged and is passing the tests. I need to add my internal pages. I need to make sure that I get my links right.
